    <h1>History of the Miata</h1>
      <p> The Mazda MX-5, commonly known as the Miata, is a lightweight roadster first sold in 1989. With over 1 million sold, this car is famous for its great handling and simple design. The philosophy that guided this design was known as 人馬一体 <em>Jinba ittai</em> which means person and horse as one body. Wanting to create a sense of oneness with the vehicle and rider, designers designed the car to be as compact and comfortable as possible.</p>

    <p>For $14,000, the first generation Miata featured a 1.6L and a 1.8L I4 producing 115 and 129 brake horsepower respectively. With its signature pop-up headlights, this generation of Miatas (my favorite generation) took inspiration from the Lotus Elan. In 1990, the NA Miata won Automobile Magazine's "Automobile of the Year."

    <p>In the second generation, Mazda (sadly) had to remove the iconic pop-up headlights due to no longer passing pedestrian safety tests. However, all is not lost as the NB featured a more powerful engine along with upgraded wheels, tires, and brakes. In addition, a Mazdaspeed variant was released and came with a turbocharger.</p>

    <h2>NC Miata (2005-2015)</h2>

    <p>The third generation, often called the "boat" in the Miata community, took inspiration from the Mazda Ibuki concept car. The NC was more bulbous, less agile, and heavier than the previous generations (leading to the boat jokes). This car is generally accepted to be the least "Miata-like" of the bunch.   </p>


        <h2>ND Miata (2015-Present)</h2>

    <p>The current generation is a much more modern take on the classic Miata. It has a more angular design along with the MX-5 RF model. Unlike the hardtops of the previous Miatas, this model features a retractable instead of a removable hardtop similar to that of the Porsche 911 Targa. Even with newer technologies, the ND is lighter than the previous generation and is the fastest Miata ever made.</p>
